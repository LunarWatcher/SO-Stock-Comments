###[Q] Incorrect AS use
Please don't tag questions with the android-studio tag just because you use it: the Android Studio tag should **only** be used when you have questions about the IDE itself, and not any code you write (or want to write) in it. See [when is it appropriate to remove an IDE tag](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/315196/6296561), [How do I avoid misusing tags?](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/354427/6296561), and [the tagging guide](/help/tagging). Use [android] or other relevant tags instead.

###[Q] Incorrect generic IDE tagging
Please don't tag questions with IDE tags just because you use that IDE: these tags should **only** be used when you have questions about the IDE itself, and not any code you write (or want to write) in it. See [when is it appropriate to remove an IDE tag](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/315196/6296561)

###[Q] Solved!!!1
Please don't add "solved" or similar phrases to your question when you've solved the problem. If someone gave you an answer, [accept it](https://stackoverflow.com/help/someone-answers). If you found a solution on your own, [post an answer](https://stackoverflow.com/help/self-answer) (you can also accept your own answer after two days). Accepting answers is also the way to show a question has been solved - editing "solved" into the question is not.
